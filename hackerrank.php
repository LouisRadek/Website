                    is a website where you can improve your coding skills in different languages. It also helps you to get better in problem solving with high complex challenges.
                    You can also get certified and compete with other programmers.
                    I started with Hackerrank in February 2022 and really enjoy it because in every challenge you have a clear goal. It gave me the opportunity to improve at coding with the providing of a lot of challenges.
                    Among all other languages, I started with Java because it is a static and object oriented language.
                    After Java, I started with the problem-solving tasks, learning more about algorithms and Data structures.
                    Then I continued with web development and learned JavaScript, by solving challenges on Hackerrank.
                    I look forward to learning  more about Data bases, Python and C/C++.
