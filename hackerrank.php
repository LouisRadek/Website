                    is a website where you can improve your coding skills in different languages. It also helps you to get better in problem solving with high complex challenges.
                    You can also get certified and compete with other programmers. 
                    I started with Hackerrank in February 2022. For me Hackerrank was really nice, because in every challenge you have a purpose to work for. 
                    The time I started with programming I really had no idea what to develop and because of that Hackerrank 
                    helped me a lot. It gave me the opportunity to get better at coding with the providing of a lot of challenges. 
                    Among all the other languages I started with Java, because it is a static typed language and object oriented. 
                    After Java I started with the problem-solving tasks, where you learn more about algorithms and Data structures.
                    Then I started with web development and to learn JavaScript I solved all challanges in this field.   
                    In the future I also want to learn more about Data bases, Python and C/C++ .
