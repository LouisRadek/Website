                    is a website where you can improve your coding skills in different languages. It also helps you to get better in problem solving with high complex challenges.
                    You can also get certified and compete with other programmers. 
                    I started with Hackerrank in February 2022. For me Hackerrank was really nice, because in every challenge you have a purpose to work for. 
                    The time I started with programming I really had no idea what to develop and because of that Hackerrank 
                    helped me a lot. It gave me the opportunity to get better at coding with the providing of a lot of challenges. 
                    Among all the other languages I started with Java, because it is really useful and runs on every computer. 
                    It took a lot of time to solve the 64 challenges, but I made it through. 
                    After Java I started with the problem-solving tasks, where you learn more about algorithms and Data structures. 
                    In the future I also want to learn Python, C/C++, SQL and more about Data bases.

                <h1>Java</h1>
                I have solved 100% of all challenges in Java and earned the 5-star Badge. 
                Furthermore, I got the Java-Certificate after solving the major test.

                At the moment I have only solved a few problem solving challenges. However, in this genre I aim for the 6-Star Badge.
